# linear-algebra

## This project focuses on implementing various basic operations in Linear Algebra, including matrix operations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, linear independence, vector basis, transformations in space, calculating L1, L2, and L-infinity norms, and finally, implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch.

## Features
- Matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, inverse)
- Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Checking linear independence and vector basis
- Transformation in space
- Calculation of L1, L2, and L-infinity norms
- PCA implementation from scratch
